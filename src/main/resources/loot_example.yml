# In this example, when the chest using loot_table 'justaname' restocks, there is a 50% chance for a diamond sword
# and a 10% chance of a 20 stack of mossy stone blocks.
# Further, '2' is rolled 10 times, with a 10% chance of EITHER 1 diamond or 5 gold, but not both.
# An additional note, the numbers used as headings can be any number or word as long as they are not the key words
# such as chance, id, amount, data and rolls.  They should be unique headings though as if they are the same, errors may occur.
