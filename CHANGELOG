Version 2.0-dev
    Fixed item data issue.  Item data is now given to restocked items!
    Now requires BukkitContrib.  This will be automatically downloaded if you do not already have it installed.
    Prettied up the in game text a little bit.  Now uses a language file.  Feel free to translate it to other languages!
    Added a timer that saves data at a configurable interval.

Version 1.1
    Added option to make chest indestructible to anyone but ops.  This will also cause explosions that hit them to be cancelled completely.
    Added option to make chests lootable only X amount of times by each player.
    Added a reload sub-command to reload the config file.
    Added a restock sub-command to immediately restock a chest.
    Added better multi-world support.  Unfortunately this WILL break existing configurations.
    Added ability to give chests a name.  This should make it a little easier to find them in the config file.
    Fixed bug that caused chests in replace mode to add items instead.

Version 1.0-beta
    Initial release!
